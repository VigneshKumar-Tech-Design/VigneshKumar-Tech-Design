Hey there! I'm Vignesh Kumar, a multi-passionate builder working across aerospace engineering, digital product design, and machine learning. I like switching between rocket engine heat flux calculations and designing sleek, user-friendly interfaces—sometimes on the same day.

🛠️ What I do (depending on the caffeine levels):

Engineer rocket cooling systems (like that sweet 500 kN FFSCC engine) 🌡️🚀

Design intuitive UX, UIs for mobile applications and online platforms (Figma is my playground) 🧩📱

Build ML models for engineering analysis and optimization (hello, GPR-PSO!) 🧠📈

🧰 Tools of choice: Python • MATLAB/Simulink • ANSYS • SolidWorks
Figma • Inkscape • PyTorch • Scikit-learn • Power BI

📦 Projects I'm proud of:

Lift Off – a responsive UI for satellite launch matchmaking

My Bachelors thesis that combined CFD with machine learning to find optimal nozzle contour

🎯 I love combining technical precision with human-centered design—because rockets should run hot, but software shouldn’t.
